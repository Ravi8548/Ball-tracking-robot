Academic Project | Bachelor's Degree

The Ball Tracking Robot is an intelligent robotic system designed to autonomously detect and follow a colored ball using real-time video processing and motor control. It combines computer vision, embedded hardware, and motion algorithms to enable responsive tracking in dynamic environments.

ðŸ”¹ Key Contributions:

Implemented real-time object detection using OpenCV to track colored balls based on HSV color space filtering and contour detection.

Interfaced camera module with onboard processor to stream and process video feeds.

Controlled motor drivers and wheels using microcontrollers to dynamically adjust the robotâ€™s movement based on the ball's position.

Developed feedback mechanisms to ensure stability and accurate tracking under varying lighting and speed conditions.

ðŸ”¹ Impact:

Demonstrated how vision-based robotics can be used in industrial automation, sports tech, and interactive robotics.

Enhanced understanding of image processing, robotic locomotion, and hardware-software integration.
This project showcases a practical application of computer vision and robotics, building the foundation for more complex systems such as autonomous vehicles, robotic assistants, and AI-driven surveillance bots.
